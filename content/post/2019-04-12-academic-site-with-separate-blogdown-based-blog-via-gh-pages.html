<p>I currently have a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> based website for my <a href="https://sahirbhatnagar.com/">academic website</a> hosted on <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/sahirbhatnagar.github.io">GitHub</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme.</p>
<div id="what-i-like-about-having-a-jekyll-based-site" class="section level2">
<h2>What I like about having a Jekyll based site</h2>
<p>Jekyll has been around for a long time now and thus has extensive documentation and support online. I also like the Jekyll-based <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It automatically generates publications from a BibTeX file using <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">jekyll-scholar</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>Information can be spread across multiple pages (e.g. papers, software, talks), which makes for a short landing page.</li>
<li>Support for news announcements.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>My main issue with the Jekyll based site, is that there isn’t an efficient way of writing blog posts using <code>R Markdown</code>. I want this functionality so that I can:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Blog about my experiences with certain <code>R</code> packages.<br />
</li>
<li>Remind myself of certain tips and tricks, i.e., a help page for my future self.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> is a popular <code>R</code> package that makes it easy to integrate <code>R Markdown</code> posts in Hugo based websites. This framework came out after I had already spent lots of time on my Jekyll based website. There also wasn’t a Hugo theme I liked enough to make the switch.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>I decided to do a hybrid Jekyll-based website with a Hugo-based blog. My main academic site at <a href="https://sahirbhatnagar.com">sahirbhatnagar.com</a> remains within the Jekyll framework and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/sahirbhatnagar.github.io">GitHub</a> with <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">GitHub User Pages</a>, and my blogdown blog is also <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/blog">hosted on GitHub</a> on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch with <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">GitHub Project Pages</a> at <a href="https://sahirbhatnagar.com/blog">sahirbhatnagar.com/blog</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I try to outline the steps I took to achieve this. This post assumes some familiarity with the <code>git</code> command line and that you already have a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages#user-and-organization-pages-sites">User Pages site on Github</a> at <code>http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>.</p>
<p>It goes something like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to your online Github account and create a new repository called <code>blog</code>. Do not initiate with a <code>README.md</code>. Do not initiate with a license.<br />
</li>
<li>On your local machine, install the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=blogdown"><code>blogdown R</code> package</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>On your local machine, create a new folder called <code>blog</code>. This will contain the source files of your blog. Make sure its empty (if its not empty, the command in Step 4 will return an error).<br />
</li>
<li>In <code>R</code> enter the following command to create a skeleton of the blogdown site</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::new_site(dir = &quot;blog/&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If all worked well, you should see a preview of the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium">hugo lithium theme (modified by Yihui Xie)</a> in the RStudio viewer pane.<br />
</li>
<li>The static files for the website are in the <code>public</code> folder, while the source files are in the top level directory (in this case, the <code>blog</code> folder). Initialize a git repository from the root of your blog folder and create a link with the remote repo created in Step 1 using:
<pre class="bash"><code>git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/blog.git
</code></pre></li>
<li>To create a new blog post run this command from the root of the blog directory (and on the <code>master</code> branch):</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::new_post(title = &quot;Name of new post&quot;, ext = &quot;.Rmd&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a <code>deploy.sh</code> script in the root of your <code>blog</code> folder so that you can automate the publication process everytime you add to your blog. The script I use will automatically build the blogdown blog and push to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. Note that you first need to push the source code to the <code>master</code> branch (the script first checks for any uncommitted changes). This script assumes that <code>blogdown::build_site()</code> will create the static files in a folder called <code>public</code>. This is what my <code>deploy.sh</code> script looks like (it makes use of <a href="https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490#gistcomment-2375522"><code>git worktrees</code></a>):</li>
</ol>
<pre class="bash"><code>#!/bin/sh

# Check if there are any uncommitted changes
if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
    echo "Changes to the following files are uncommitted:"
    git diff-index --name-only HEAD --
    echo "Please commit the changes to master branch (which contains the source files of this blog) before proceeding."
    echo "Aborting."
    [[ "$0" = "$BASH_SOURCE" ]] && exit 1 || return 1
fi

echo "Deleting old publication"
rm -rf .git/worktrees/public/

echo "Make worktree"
git worktree add public gh-pages

echo "Generating site"
Rscript -e "blogdown::build_site()"

echo "Adding and committing to gh-pages branch"
cd public && git add --all && git commit -m "$1"

echo "Pushing to gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages

echo "Cleaning up files"
cd ..
git worktree prune

rm -rf public

</code></pre>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>After running <code>chmod +x deploy.sh</code>, you can then call the script using</li>
</ol>
<pre class="bash"><code>./deploy.sh "commit message of your choice"
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all I have for now. I hope this framework will work for me and meet my needs to maintain my academic website, as well as a blogdown blog.</p>
