<h1>Git without the command line</h1>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> as my preferred graphical user interface (GUI) for version control with <code>git</code>. It’s very intuitive, has nice a visual commit history, and my favorite feature is the drag and drop for merging branches. In this post, I list some of the most used features. I will also constantly update this post with new things I learn about this tool.</p>

<h1>Setting the default merge and diff tool</h1>
<p><a href="https://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a> is the tool I use when I want to compare two (or more) files. Recently I learned that Meld can be used for resolving merge conflicts in git. In order for GitKraken to automatically use Meld as the default merge tool, you need to modify your <code>.gitconfig</code> file (which is usually found in your home directory). <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34119866/setting-up-and-using-meld-as-your-git-difftool-and-mergetool">This Stack Overlflow answer</a> nicely explains the required commands.</p>
<p>Here is what my (the relevant part) <code>.gitconfig</code> file looks like:</p>
<pre class="git"><code>[diff]
  tool = meld
[difftool]
  prompt = false
[difftool &quot;meld&quot;]
  cmd = meld \&quot;$LOCAL\&quot; \&quot;$REMOTE\&quot;
[merge]
    tool = meld
[mergetool &quot;meld&quot;]
    # Choose one of these 2 lines (not both!).
    cmd = meld \&quot;$LOCAL\&quot; \&quot;$MERGED\&quot; \&quot;$REMOTE\&quot; --output \&quot;$MERGED\&quot;
    #cmd = meld &quot;$LOCAL&quot; &quot;$BASE&quot; &quot;$REMOTE&quot; --output &quot;$MERGED&quot;</code></pre>
<p>When resolving a merge conflict Meld will display 3 panes with $LOCAL and $REMOTE in the left and right panes and either $MERGED or $BASE in the middle pane (depending on which of the two <code>cmd</code> you uncomment above). As state in the SO post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In BOTH cases the middle pane is the file that you should edit to resolve the merge conflicts. The difference is just in which starting edit position you’d prefer; $MERGED for the file which contains the partially merged file with the merge conflict information or $BASE for the shared commit ancestor of $LOCAL and $REMOTE</p>
